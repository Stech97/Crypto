In order to get the most profit out of all\n            possibilities of decentralized finance, it is of utmost importance to\n            have huge investments and useful knowledge.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            So, the reason why we developed the DEFIMA platform is to give investors\n            an easy accessibility to invest in DeFi products without having a lot of\n            knowledge nor a big budget.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            All of the investor’s money will be bundled in a big pool. With this\n            pool, we can reach higher profits, better security and long-term\n            investments.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            With this advantage, we can reach up to 11% on your investment each\n            month. This wouldn’t be possible, if everyone is on his own.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            Our mission is to give everyone an easy way to join the very profitable\n            DeFi lending market.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nconst OurmissionIcons = () => {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"ourmission-icons\">\n            <div className=\"ourmission-iconbox-1\">\n                <img\n                  className=\"ourmission-icon-image-1\"\n                  src=\"img/ourmission-icon-1.png\"\n                  alt=\"ourmission-icon-1\"\n                  srcSet=\"img/ourmission-icon-1@2x.png 2x, img/ourmission-icon-1@3x.png 3x\"\n                />\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"ourmission-iconbox-2\">\n                <img\n                  className=\"ourmission-icon-image-2\"\n                  src=\"img/ourmission-icon-2.png\"\n                  alt=\"ourmission-icon-2\"\n                  srcSet=\"img/ourmission-icon-2@2x.png 2x, img/ourmission-icon-2@3x.png 3x\"\n                />\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"ourmission-iconbox-3\">\n                <img\n                  className=\"ourmission-icon-image-3\"\n                  src=\"img/ourmission-icon-3.png\"\n                  alt=\"ourmission-icon-3\"\n                  srcSet=\"img/ourmission-icon-3@2x.png 2x, img/ourmission-icon-3@3x.png 3x\"\n                />\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"ourmission-iconbox-4\">\n                <img\n                  className=\"ourmission-icon-image-4\"\n                  src=\"img/ourmission-icon-4.png\"\n                  alt=\"ourmission-icon-4\"\n                  srcSet=\"img/ourmission-icon-4@2x.png 2x, img/ourmission-icon-4@3x.png 3x\"\n                />\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nclass Ourmission extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n        <section className=\"ourmission\">\n            <div className=\"wrapper\">\n                <OurmissionHeader />\n                <OurmissionText />\n                <OurmissionIcons />\n            </div>\n        </section>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Ourmission","import React, { Component } from 'react'\n\nconst HowitworksHeader = () => {\n\treturn (\n\t    <div className=\"howitworks-header\">\n\t      <h1>How It Works</h1>\n\t      <h2>Business model</h2>\n\t    </div>\n\t)\n}\n\nconst HowitworksScheme = () => {\n\treturn (\n\t    <div className=\"howitworks-scheme\">\n\t    \t<img src=\"img/howitworks_scheme.png\" alt=\"howitworks_scheme\" />\n\t    </div>\n\t)\n}\n\nconst howitworksPoints = [\n\t{\n\t\tid: 1,\n\t\theader: \"Investor\",\n\t\ttext: \"The Investor deposits and buys a product.\"\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tid: 2,\n\t\theader: \"Defima Pool\",\n\t\ttext: \"Every Investor is a small part of the Defima pool.
