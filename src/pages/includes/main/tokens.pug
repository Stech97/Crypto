      .defimatoken-content-text
        p Defima Token is a cryptocurrency token and operates on the Ethereum platform. We developed the token in order to get more financial power to build the platform.
        p All profits and commission earnings will be paid out in our defimatoken. You can, of course, always exchange the token to Bitcoin or USD, and withdraw the money.
        p For now, the token is only reserved for all Defima investors, and you can only get defimatoken by profits or commissions from Defima products. One token is currently worth 1 USD.
        p As part of its strategy plan, Defima plans to make a public sale (ICO) in the near future. When this happens, we expect that the token will double or triple its price. We recommend all Defima investors to hold as many defimatoken as possible in order to benefit from the public sale.
